Here is the logic of 69105 more keys. Well, both rooms. It covers both how I figured things out and how you can.

Each puzzle relies on how two numbers factor.

I used a PERL program to determine a number's factors. 69105 had 271 as a factor, so first, I wanted to go with something odd, with no factor greater than 30.

69069 was such a number, and it went in room 69105a, which wasn't even 69105a at first. I didn't know there'd be a 69105b.

69069 = 23*13*11*7*3. (Math team/trivia types will recognize 1001=13*11*7 immediately.)

For factor X, we then have the following:

--descriptions that aren't unique are weighted by 2
--descriptions that are unique are weighted by 1

--the remaining 36 keys are in a "worst" combination. In other words, one of the 11*6*5*3*1-1=989 wrong combinations gets them. So you get a fun message if you find that. It's probably best done by guessing one at a time.

The game thus becomes a puzzle to detect by trial and error which are right. You only know how many keys you've got right, though.

69105b allows for a bit more targeted guessing. It's based on how 69105 factors.

69105 = 271 * 17 * 5 * 3

Now, the number of keys in a wrong guess is weighted differently. You may see this as you play through.

271=1+9+13+17+21+25+29+33+37+41+45
17=1+3+5+8
5=1+2+2
3=1+2

You'll notice there aren't a lot of even numbers. So if the number is divisible by 8, 17 (writing) is wrong, and you can divide what you have by 8.

If that number is divisible by 4, both 5 (textures) and 3 (grooves) are wrong.

If 2, one is wrong. So you can, in fact, twiddle grooves and textures on move 2. If the next number is divisible by 2, you know you had 1 right and 1 wrong both ways, so you need 2 more guesses.

If it's divisible by 4, yay!

If it's divisible by 0, then you know 3 must've been right and your guesses for 5 were wrong.

Now you need to pay attention to 17*271. The only possible mess is if you get a product of 45. Then you may have 5/9 or 1/45. But if you make a different guess with both, you should be able to detect things. If it's still 35, change only one of the guesses next time.

This leaves a bit of an unfortunate mess of guesswork for 271. Sorry. Blame the number, not me!

(Note: a possibility here was 271=1+57+64+71+78. Then we would use similar reasoning to see that if a number was divisible by 64, then 271 was wrong. Or if by 13, then 271 was wrong--it was 78.)
