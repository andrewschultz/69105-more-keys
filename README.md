69105 More Keys

Spring Thing 2019 back garden game

Release 2: December 2021

A silly diversion and a sort of sequel to David Welbourn's 69105 Keys. I also used it as a programming exercise for Inform. It was originally in the Spring Thing 2019 Back Garden.

There are initially two rooms where you can trap yourself and need to find 69105 keys. A third room opens up later, and it's based on the second.

This game was created with the help of some PERL scripts used to factor numbers. Yes, 69105 was one. The other was slightly less than 69105 but had many small factors, and it also allowed for a "worst case" set of keys to find.

Thanks to David Welbourn for the original idea and Aaron Reed for continuing to hold Spring Thing, so experimental stuff like this has a place. I'm just disappointed I didn't make it better in the first place.
