69105 More Keys

Spring Thing 2019 game

Release 2: July 2021

A silly diversion and a sort of sequel to David Welbourn's 69105 Keys. I also used it as a programming exercise for Inform.

There are two ways to find which of the 69105 keys is the one for the door. You can take a branch.

This game was created with the help of some PERL scripts used to factor numbers. Yes, 69105 was one. There was another.
